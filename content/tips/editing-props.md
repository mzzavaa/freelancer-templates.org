      - type: "rule"
        title: "Use PNG for Logos"
        body: "PNG format supports transparency, making logos more versatile. They can be placed on any background color without visible edges or artifacts."

    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Duration Props"
        body: "Timing props control how long elements appear and when animations occur. The main duration prop is typically <code>durationInFrames</code>, calculated as seconds × fps (e.g., 5 seconds at 30fps = 150 frames)."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Platform Considerations"
        body: "Different platforms have different ideal lengths. Instagram Reels work well at 15-30 seconds, TikTok at 15-60 seconds, and YouTube Shorts at up to 60 seconds."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Allow Reading Time"
        body: "Give viewers enough time to read text. A good rule of thumb: 3-4 seconds for headlines, 5-7 seconds for longer text blocks. Test playback to ensure comfortable pacing."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Frame Rate Awareness"
        body: "Most templates use 30fps. When calculating duration, multiply seconds by the frame rate. For 60fps compositions, the same 5-second video requires 300 frames instead of 150."
