        title: "What is a Theme?"
        body: "A theme is a coordinated set of visual styles—colors, typography, spacing, and effects—that creates a consistent look across your videos. Themes use design tokens to ensure every element follows the same visual language."
        source: "Design Systems Principles"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Theme Anatomy"
        body: "A complete theme includes several key components that work together to create visual harmony."
        list:
          - "Color palette: Primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors"
          - "Typography: Font families, sizes, and weights"
          - "Gradients: Background and overlay gradients"
          - "Spacing: Consistent padding and margins"
          - "Effects: Shadows, borders, and animations"

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Design Tokens"
        body: "Design tokens are named values that represent visual properties. Instead of using raw values like <code>#6366f1</code>, use semantic names like <code>primary</code> or <code>brandColor</code>. This makes themes easier to maintain and swap."
        source: "Design Token Specification"

      - type: "example"
        title: "Basic Theme Object"
        body: "Start with a simple theme structure that organizes your visual properties into logical groups. This object becomes the foundation for all your customizations."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Semantic Naming"
        body: "Name tokens by their purpose, not their value. Use <code>textPrimary</code> instead of <code>darkGray</code>, and <code>surfaceElevated</code> instead of <code>lightBlue</code>. This makes themes more flexible and easier to update."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Token Hierarchy"
        body: "Organize tokens in layers: primitive tokens (raw values), semantic tokens (purpose-based), and component tokens (specific to UI elements). This hierarchy enables systematic theme changes."
        source: "Design Systems Best Practices"

  - title: "Color Palette Creation"
    description: "Build harmonious color palettes with primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors that work together beautifully."
    columns: 2
    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Primary Colors"
        body: "Your primary color is the dominant brand color used for key elements like buttons, links, and highlights. Include light and dark variants for flexibility."
        source: "Color Theory for UI Design"

      - type: "example"
        title: "Before: Single Color"
        body: "Using just one color value limits your design options and makes it hard to create visual hierarchy or indicate different states."

      - type: "example"
        title: "After: Color Scale"
        body: "A complete color scale with light, base, and dark variants enables hover states, backgrounds, and text on colored surfaces while maintaining brand consistency."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Secondary & Accent Colors"
        body: "Add supporting colors for variety and emphasis. Secondary colors complement your primary, while accent colors draw attention to specific elements like success states or calls-to-action."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Neutral Colors"
        body: "Neutrals provide backgrounds, text colors, and borders. Build a scale from near-white to near-black with 8-10 steps for maximum flexibility in both light and dark themes."
        source: "Accessible Color Systems"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Dark Theme Neutrals"
        body: "For dark themes, use cool-tinted neutrals (slight blue undertone) for backgrounds. This creates depth and feels more natural than pure grays. Example: <code>#0f172a</code> instead of <code>#1a1a1a</code>."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Complete Palette"
        body: "A production-ready palette includes primary (3 shades), secondary, accent, and neutrals (background, surface, text, textMuted, border). This covers all common UI needs."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Color Contrast"
        body: "Ensure sufficient contrast for readability. Large text needs minimum 3:1 contrast ratio, body text needs 4.5:1. Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify."
        source: "WCAG 2.1 Guidelines"

  - title: "Typography Configuration"
    description: "Define a consistent type system with font families, size scales, and weights that create clear visual hierarchy."
    columns: 3
    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Font Families"
        body: "Choose fonts that reflect your brand personality. Most themes need two families: one for headings (often bolder, more distinctive) and one for body text (optimized for readability)."
        source: "Typography Best Practices"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Font Pairing"
        body: "Pair fonts with contrasting characteristics. A geometric sans-serif heading with a humanist body font creates visual interest while maintaining readability."
        list:
          - "Inter + Inter (clean, modern)"
          - "Space Grotesk + Inter (tech, creative)"
          - "Playfair Display + Source Sans (elegant)"

      - type: "example"
        title: "Before: Arbitrary Sizes"
        body: "Using random font sizes like 17px, 23px, 41px creates visual chaos. There's no clear hierarchy, and the design feels inconsistent."

      - type: "example"
        title: "After: Type Scale"
        body: "A harmonious scale like 14, 16, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72 creates clear hierarchy. Each size has a purpose, from captions to hero headlines."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Type Scale Ratios"
        body: "Build your scale using a consistent ratio. Common ratios include 1.25 (Major Third), 1.333 (Perfect Fourth), and 1.5 (Perfect Fifth). Multiply your base size by the ratio for each step."
        source: "Modular Scale Typography"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Font Weights"
        body: "Limit weights to 3-4 options: regular (400) for body, medium (500) for emphasis, semibold (600) for subheadings, and bold (700) for headings. Too many weights dilute hierarchy."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Line Height"
        body: "Set line height based on context. Headings use tight line height (1.1-1.2), body text uses comfortable spacing (1.5-1.6), and small text may need more (1.6-1.8)."
        source: "Readability Guidelines"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Video Typography"
        body: "For video, increase font sizes 20-30% compared to web. Viewers watch from a distance, and text appears on screen briefly. Prioritize legibility over density."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Complete Typography System"
        body: "A production typography config includes heading and body font families, a size scale (xs through 6xl), weight options, and line height values for different contexts."

  - title: "Gradients and Effects"
    description: "Add depth and visual interest with gradients, shadows, and other effects that enhance your theme without overwhelming it."
    columns: 2
    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Linear Gradients"
        body: "Linear gradients transition colors along a straight line. Use them for backgrounds, buttons, and overlays. Specify direction (180deg = top to bottom) and color stops."
        source: "CSS Gradient Specification"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Gradient Directions"
        body: "Choose direction based on content flow. Vertical gradients (180deg) work for full-screen backgrounds. Diagonal gradients (135deg) add energy. Horizontal gradients (90deg) suit wide banners."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Before: Flat Background"
        body: "A solid color background can feel static and uninteresting, especially for video content that benefits from visual depth and movement."

      - type: "example"
        title: "After: Gradient Background"
        body: "A subtle gradient from <code>#6366f1</code> to <code>#4f46e5</code> adds depth while maintaining brand color. The transition creates visual interest without distraction."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Radial Gradients"
        body: "Radial gradients emanate from a center point. Use them for spotlight effects, glows, and vignettes. Control shape (circle/ellipse) and position (center, top right, etc.)."
        source: "CSS Gradient Specification"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Gradient Overlays"
        body: "Use gradient overlays to improve text readability over images. A dark gradient from transparent to 80% black ensures text remains legible regardless of the underlying image."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Multi-Stop Gradients"
        body: "Create complex gradients with multiple color stops. A sunset gradient might transition through orange, pink, and purple. Keep stops harmonious—use adjacent colors on the color wheel."
        source: "Color Theory for Gradients"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Shadow Effects"
        body: "Shadows add depth and hierarchy. Use subtle shadows for cards and elevated surfaces. For video, increase shadow opacity slightly as screens vary in contrast."
        list:
          - "Subtle: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
          - "Medium: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"
          - "Strong: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)"

      - type: "example"
        title: "Glow Effects"
        body: "Create glows using radial gradients or box shadows with your brand color. A subtle glow around key elements draws attention without harsh edges. Example: <code>0 0 40px rgba(99,102,241,0.4)</code>."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Animation Timing"
        body: "Define consistent easing curves for animations. Use ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits, and ease-in-out for state changes. Store these as theme tokens for consistency."

  - title: "Saving and Reusing Themes"
    description: "Learn to save your themes as reusable presets and apply them consistently across all your video projects."
    columns: 3
    cards:
      - type: "rule"

        body: "Save themes as separate files that can be imported into any project. Use a consistent structure with colors, typography, gradients, and effects sections."
        source: "Code Organization Best Practices"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Theme Presets"
        body: "Create preset themes for different contexts: corporate (professional blues), creative (vibrant gradients), minimal (clean neutrals). Switch between them by changing a single import."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Corporate Theme Preset"
        body: "A corporate preset uses trustworthy blues, clean typography, and subtle effects. Colors: primary <code>#1e40af</code>, background <code>#ffffff</code>, text <code>#1e293b</code>. Font: Inter for both headings and body."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Creative Theme Preset"
        body: "A creative preset uses bold colors and dynamic gradients. Colors: primary <code>#f97316</code>, secondary <code>#8b5cf6</code>, dark background <code>#18181b</code>. Font: Space Grotesk for headings."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Dark/Light Variants"
        body: "Create both dark and light versions of your theme. Store them in a themes object with <code>dark</code> and <code>light</code> keys. Switch based on context or user preference."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Theme Application"
        body: "Apply themes through props or a theme provider. Pass individual values for simple templates, or pass the entire theme object for templates with full theme support."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "CSS Variables Export"
        body: "Export your theme as CSS custom properties for maximum flexibility. This enables theming of any CSS-based styling and works across different component libraries."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Theme Switching"
        body: "Implement theme switching by storing the current theme in state. Change the entire look of your video by updating a single variable. Great for A/B testing different brand treatments."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Version Control"
        body: "Track theme changes in version control. Document what changed and why. This creates a history of your brand evolution and makes it easy to revert if needed."
