        body: "Templates organize content in nested containers. The root container matches the canvas size, while child containers group related elements. Understanding this hierarchy is key to making effective modifications."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Before: Flat Structure"
        body: "A flat layout with all elements at the same level makes it difficult to move groups of related content together or apply consistent styling."

      - type: "example"
        title: "After: Nested Containers"
        body: "Grouping related elements in containers (header, content, footer) enables you to move entire sections at once and apply consistent spacing within each group."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Identify Layout Layers"
        body: "Most templates have three main layers: background (images, gradients), content (text, cards), and overlay (logos, watermarks). Each layer uses different positioning strategies."

        title: "Absolute Positioning"
        body: "Use <code>position: 'absolute'</code> with <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>bottom</code> values to place elements at exact pixel coordinates. This gives you precise control over element placement."
        source: "CSS Positioning Specification"

      - type: "example"

          - "top: 150"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Centering Elements"
        body: "Center elements using the transform technique: set <code>left: '50%'</code> and <code>transform: 'translateX(-50%)'</code> for horizontal centering. Add <code>top: '50%'</code> and <code>translateY(-50%)</code> for vertical centering."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Edge Alignment"
        body: "Align elements to canvas edges using <code>right</code> and <code>bottom</code> instead of <code>left</code> and <code>top</code>. This anchors elements to the opposite edges, useful for logos and watermarks."
        source: "Layout Best Practices"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Z-Index Layering"
        body: "Control stacking order with <code>zIndex</code>. Background elements use low values (0-10), content uses medium values (10-50), and overlays use high values (50+). This ensures elements appear in the correct order."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Safe Zones"
        body: "Keep important content within safe zones—typically 60px from all edges. This prevents cropping on different platforms and ensures text remains readable when UI elements overlay the video."

    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Fixed Dimensions"
        body: "Set explicit <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values in pixels for precise control. This is ideal for elements that should maintain exact sizes regardless of content."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Percentage-Based Sizing"
        body: "Use percentages for responsive sizing: <code>width: '100%'</code> fills the container width, <code>width: '50%'</code> takes half. This adapts to different canvas sizes automatically."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Aspect Ratio Preservation"
        body: "Maintain proportions when resizing with <code>aspectRatio: '16 / 9'</code>. Set one dimension and let the other calculate automatically. Essential for images and video containers."
        source: "CSS Aspect Ratio Property"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Consistent Spacing Scale"
        body: "Use a spacing scale for consistency: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96 pixels. Apply these values for padding, margins, and gaps. Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and professionalism."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Object Fit for Media"
        body: "Control how images fill their containers with <code>objectFit</code>: 'cover' fills the container (may crop), 'contain' fits entirely (may letterbox), 'fill' stretches to fit."
        source: "CSS Object Fit Property"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Max Width for Text"
        body: "Limit text container width with <code>maxWidth</code> for better readability. Aim for 60-80 characters per line. For video, this typically means 600-900px depending on font size."

    description: "Leverage CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible, powerful layouts that adapt to content and simplify complex arrangements."
    columns: 2
    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Flexbox Basics"
        body: "Flexbox arranges items along a single axis. Use <code>display: 'flex'</code> with <code>flexDirection: 'row'</code> for horizontal layouts or <code>'column'</code> for vertical. Add <code>gap</code> for consistent spacing."
        source: "CSS Flexbox Specification"

      - type: "example"
        title: "Before: Stacked Elements"
        body: "Elements stack vertically by default, requiring manual positioning for horizontal layouts."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Flex Alignment"

      - type: "rule"
        title: "CSS Grid Basics"
        body: "Grid creates two-dimensional layouts. Use <code>display: 'grid'</code> with <code>gridTemplateColumns</code> to define columns. <code>repeat(3, 1fr)</code> creates three equal columns."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "When to Use Each"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Nested Layouts"
        body: "Combine Grid and Flexbox for complex layouts. Use Grid for the overall page structure, then Flexbox within individual cells for content alignment."

    columns: 3
    cards:
      - type: "rule"
        title: "Aspect Ratio Detection"
        body: "Detect orientation by comparing width and height: <code>const isPortrait = height > width</code>. Use this to conditionally apply different layouts for landscape vs portrait compositions."
        source: "Responsive Design Principles"

      - type: "example"
        title: "Before: Fixed Layout"
        body: "A layout designed for landscape may not work well when rendered in portrait orientation, with elements overlapping or extending beyond the canvas."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Content Scaling"
        body: "Scale content proportionally with <code>transform: scale()</code>. Calculate scale factor: <code>Math.min(width / 1920, height / 1080)</code> to fit content designed for 1080p into any canvas size."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Platform-Specific Safe Zones"
        body: "Different platforms have different UI overlays. Instagram/TikTok need larger top (120px) and bottom (180px) margins for usernames and captions. YouTube uses standard 60px margins."
        source: "Social Media Design Guidelines"

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Test Multiple Sizes"
        body: "Always preview your layout at different aspect ratios before finalizing. Create test compositions at 16:9, 9:16, and 1:1 to ensure your layout adapts correctly."

      - type: "example"
        title: "Responsive Text Sizing"
        body: "Scale text based on canvas dimensions for consistent visual weight."

      - type: "rule"
        title: "Flexible vs Fixed Elements"
        body: "Identify which elements should scale (backgrounds, containers) and which should remain fixed (logos, icons, minimum text sizes). This prevents tiny unreadable text or oversized UI elements."

      - type: "tip"
        title: "Breakpoint Patterns"
